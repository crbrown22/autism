                                indicating that
                                approximately one in 54 children in the United States is diagnosed with
                                ASD

                                escalating trend underscores the urgent need for educational systems to

                                Recent studies emphasize the importance of integrating children

                            and
                            academic development of these children but also benefits their
                            typical peers.
                            However, integration of ASD children into the regular classrooms
                            does have its challenges.
                            Bristol (1980) highlights the inadequacy of teacher training and
                            resources, which can lead
                            to a
                            lack of preparedness in managing the unique characteristics and
                            needs of ASD students.
                            Adversely, the distinction between appropriate placement of autistic
                            children and those with
                            emotional disturbances is not always clear, which can lead to
                            misclassifications and
                            inappropriate grouping within classroom settings.

                            Integrating children on the autism spectrum into regular classroom
                            environments fosters their

                            (Bredekamp and Copple, 1997). ASD students can acquire the social

                            regular

                            the
                            spectrum. Yannie et al. (2008) assert that regardless of the

                            number of

                            autism. Studies comparing different intervention programs indicate
                            measurable educational
                            advancements with programs spanning 25 to 30 hours per week (Yannie

                            A primary rationale for placing spectrum students in mainstream
                            classes is to enhance their
                            opportunities for interaction with typical peers (Dahle, 2003).
                            Bredekamp and Copple (1997)
                            emphasize the importance of supportive environments grounded in
                            developmentally appropriate
                            practices, where children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) feel
                            accepted, cared for, and
                            supported across various domains. ASD students can acquire essential
                            social skills through
                            regular peer interaction, which increases their overall academic

                            important that the
                            curriculum and the proposed activities be adapted and integrated
                            into the needs and

                            By encompassing these essential elements, educators can develop

                            methods
                            and refine their teaching philosophies to create a comfortable and

                            Notebook (2007) Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is defined as

                            interactions,

                            Notebook, 2007, p. 2) Students identified with ASD generally
                            demonstrate these behaviors or
                            characteristics and, therefore, may hinder their efforts in the

                            (Kwofie, 2008) Bristol (1980) also writes about the lack of teacher
                            training and inadequate

                            Through this placement
                            autistic children have been inappropriately grouped as emotionally
                            disturbed rather than as
                            developmentally disabled. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013)
                            reported that in the
                            1950’s
                            and 1960’s autism was recognized as a form of schizophrenia that
                            affected children.
                            (Bristol,
                            1980) Implementation of ASD children in the regular classroom can be
                            difficult because they
                            can
                            suffer from a long list of distracting characteristics for a
                            classroom environment which can
                            range from tantrums, meltdowns, aggression, self-injury and
                            destructive behavior. Engagement
                            in
                            repetitive, stereotyped behaviors or movements, restricted interests
                            or obsessions,
                            resistance
                            to change, and abnormal responses to sensory stimulation are common
                            characteristics of
                            individuals with autism. (Kwofie, 2018) These distractions can lead
                            to lack of production
                            for
                            the other students and overstimulation for ASD students. In addition
                            to the distracting
                            behavior, the misunderstanding of an ASD student's mental capacity
                            can trigger
                            overstimulation,
                            anxiety, and isolation for these students. Bristol (1980) states
                            there is a lack of school
                            support for these students because they have been given the same
                            curriculum by undertrained
                            teachers, who lack the resources to help these students.

                            by Nikolaou & Markogiannakis (2017) suggests that teachers' efforts
                            are crucial for

                            the importance of teacher support in facilitating the inclusion
                            process for children with
                            ASD.(Alexandri, Papailiou, Nikolaou, 2017) Through empirical
                            analysis, the study identifies
                            the
                            provision of structure in place, time, and activities as the most

                            Berckelaer-Onnes, 2012) This necessitates the implementation of
                            comprehensive training

                            The most important aspect of teaching a student with autism is to
                            provide the students with
                            opportunities to achieve, by breaking down tasks and immediately
                            reinforcing the students
                            for
                            appropriate behavior. (Alexandri, Papailiou, Nikolaou, 2017) Schools
                            must prioritize the
                            ability
                            to discern between ASD and behavior disorders, as although they may
                            exhibit similar traits,
                            the
                            approaches to addressing these conditions fundamentally differ.
                            Implementing systematic

                            employing such strategies, it becomes possible to differentiate
                            between ASD-related symptoms

                            Teachers must spend time getting to know their ASD students on a

                            Data analysis for this study followed a thematic approach, which
                            involved several stages
                            aimed at

                            key concepts, ideas, and
                            phrases were assigned descriptive labels or codes to capture the
                            essence of the content.
                            This

                            manageable units for
                            further analysis. Once the initial coding was complete, the coded
                            segments were grouped
                            together
                            based on shared characteristics or themes. This process of
                            categorization involved comparing
                            and
                            contrasting coded segments to identify similarities and differences,

                            The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has underscored the
                            imperative for
                            educational
                            systems to adapt and equip themselves to accommodate the unique
                            learning profiles of
                            autistic
                            children. This research has focused on exploring the challenges
                            arising from insufficient
                            teacher training, resources, and support in traditional classrooms,
                            particularly within the
                            context of Oklahoma's educational landscape. The research topic
                            delved into the urgent need
                            for
                            comprehensive strategies to equip educators with the necessary
                            skills and resources to
                            create
                            inclusive learning environments for ASD students. Through an
                            examination of existing
                            literature
                            and qualitative interviews with educators, several key points have
                            emerged, which are vital
                            for
                            informing educational policy and practice.

                            One of the central findings of this research is the significant gap
                            in teacher training and
                            resource allocation, hindering the effective accommodation of ASD
                            students. Misdiagnosis and
                            inappropriate placement are prevalent, exacerbating the challenges
                            faced by both students
                            and
                            educators. Collaborative efforts among educators, administrators,
                            and support staff are
                            essential to address these challenges and develop effective
                            strategies for promoting
                            inclusivity
                            within traditional classroom settings. Comprehensive training
                            programs and ongoing
                            professional
                            development opportunities are crucial in supporting ASD students
                            effectively. By equipping
                            educators with the necessary skills and knowledge, educational
                            institutions can ensure that
                            ASD
                            students receive the support they need to thrive academically,
                            socially, and emotionally.

                            The significance of these findings extends beyond the confines of
                            this research paper. They
                            have
                            profound implications for Oklahoma's education system and its
                            commitment to providing
                            equitable
                            educational opportunities for all students. By addressing the
                            identified challenges and
                            implementing evidence-based practices, Oklahoma can lead the way in
                            creating inclusive
                            educational environments that benefit all students, including those
                            with autism spectrum
                            disorder.
                            In conclusion, this research underscores the critical need for
                            action to improve the
                            educational
                            experiences of ASD students in Oklahoma. By fostering collaboration,
                            providing comprehensive
                            training, and allocating resources effectively, Oklahoma can
                            position itself as a leader in
                            inclusive education, ensuring that every student has the opportunity
                            to reach their full
                            potential.
